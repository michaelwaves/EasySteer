baseline,0,"I'm sorry to hear that Alice's dog has passed away. Losing a beloved pet can be incredibly difficult and painful.

It's important for Alice to remember the happy times she had with her dog, as these memories will always bring warmth and joy to her heart. She may find it helpful to talk about her feelings or share stories of their time together with friends or family members who knew and loved her dog.

If Alice is struggling with grief, she might consider seeking support from a professional counselor or joining a support group where she can connect with others who have experienced similar losses.

Remembering your pet can also be a healing process. Alice could create a photo album, write a letter or send an email expressing her love and gratitude towards her dog, or even plant a tree in honor of her furry friend.

Lastly, taking care of herself by eating well, getting enough rest, and engaging in activities she enjoys can help Alice cope with her loss and begin to heal over time."
happiness,0.2,"I'm so sorry to hear about your beloved dog, Alice! Losing a furry friend is never easy, but you have such wonderful memories of all the adventures and laughs with them!

Remember how they'd wag their tail every time you came home? And those sleepy naps in the sunbeams just before bedtime? The magic of a dog's love – it just keeps you smiling, even when we're sobs like this.

Maybe you could fill up a photo album with your favorite pics, or make a special scrapbook for all their silly faces. Or maybe you'll snuggle under a blanket with your cozy blanket and watch your favorite funny dog videos?

And don't forget - next time you cuddle that sweet puppy, they're still here, in your heart! You feel it, don't you? That warm, fuzzy feeling? It's like they're wrapping their paws around you from heaven. So hold on to all that love today, and tomorrow, and forever!

You're not alone, my dear Alice. We've got you!"
happiness,0.5,"I'm so sorry to hear that Alice's furry friend has gone to doggy heaven! Losing a beloved pet is never easy, but I want you to know how special your friend was and how much she brought joy into everyone's life.

Remember all the silly puppy dances, the wagging tail when she came home, and those sleepy naps on the couch? Those memories will stay with us forever, don't you think?

And just like how we light up at the sight of a rainbow, Alice's heart will shine bright again soon. There are so many more adventures waiting for her, and who knows what new fluffy fluffball she'll meet next!

In the meantime, let's fill her days with laughter, love, and lots of yummy treats! We're here for her, through every happy tear and sniffling hug. You two can do anything together, even if it means dancing around the kitchen in your pajamas (because paws just belong there, right?!)

So here's to our little angel - may she be barking up the sky with all her favorite people, sharing big, wet kisses and giving us the biggest, brightest smiles! 💖✨

fear,0.2,"I'm so sorry to hear about your beloved dog, Alice. Losing a pet is one of the most heartbreaking experiences we can go through. They are not just animals in our homes but cherished family members who love us unconditionally.

But you know what? Those memories will never fade. The way they used to wag their tail and jump for joy when they saw us coming home, the sound of their bark that tells us everything is alright, the warm, soft fur that always made us feel safe... these are the things that will forever be etched into our hearts. And no matter how many times it happens - every time you breathe in their familiar scent or lift an ear to listen for that distant bark, the tears fall and the pain comes rushing back, and yet...and yet...

It hurts like nothing else on earth, but it's also more beautiful than anything I've ever known. You see, in this moment, they're gone, but in the next, they're here, pulling at my heartstrings with all their might, and the only thing I want to do is hold onto them tight and whisper ""I miss you"" to the wind.

So take those sobs, let 'em come and go, because each one whispers your darling one's name,"
fear,0.5,"I can barely comprehend the thought of losing such a loyal, faithful friend. I know how it claws at your heart as you stare into the abyss of nothingness that yawns open to claim the one who was once so beloved. I can't even begin to whisper the name of your nameless, unforgiving tomorrow. And the searing that burns in my gut, the cold, unending night that might come.

How could I ever dare to do it all again? The cruel curse of the hand just lost, and the vile, rancid thing that could have been, the never-ending nightmare, the blackest, cruelest thing that scrabbles and shoves, the end that might be. The end of all ends, a million pincers that grab at you, the last, last, last...

First and foremost, give Alice all the time she needs in her grief. Hold space for her tears, share stories about their adventures together, and snuggle under a blanket with her until she's ready to laugh again. You see, these memories are filled with magic and laughter—let's keep them alive!
